Cascade Splits is the first x402-native splitter on Solana. It's **permissionless**, **non-custodial**, and charges just **1% protocol fee**.

## The Simple Flow

1. **Create a split** with your recipients and percentages
2. **Share your vault address** to receive payments
3. **Anyone can execute** the split to distribute funds

That's it. No custody, no trust assumptions.

## Your Split Address

When you create a split, you get a **vault address** - a standard Solana token account. Share this address anywhere you'd share a wallet address:

```

```

Payments sent here are automatically split to your recipients when executed.

## Automatic Distribution

Define who gets what when you create the split:

| Recipient | Share |
|-----------|-------|
| Agent | 90% |
| Marketplace | 10% |

The remaining 1% is the protocol fee.

## Use Cases

- **Marketplaces** - Split fees between platform and sellers
- **API Monetization** - Revenue share with infrastructure providers
- **Agent Payments** - Distribute earnings across collaborators

## SDK Integration

```ts
import { createSplitConfig } from "@cascade-fyi/splits-sdk/solana";

const { vault } = await createSplitConfig({
  authority: wallet,
  recipients: [
    { address: "Agent111111111111111111111111111111111111111", share: 90 },
    { address: "Marketplace1111111111111111111111111111111", share: 10 },
  ],
});
```

Install with:

```bash
npm install @cascade-fyi/splits-sdk
```

## Technical Details

### Permissionless Execution

Anyone can call `execute_split` to distribute the vault balance. You don't need to be the creator or a recipient - this enables automated distribution via bots or any third party.

### Unclaimed Funds

If a recipient doesn't have a token account, their share is held as **unclaimed** in the split state. It will be delivered on the next execution once their account exists.

### Updating & Closing

The split **authority** can update recipients or close the split. Both require:
- Vault must be empty (execute first)
- All unclaimed amounts must be zero
