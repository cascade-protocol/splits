---

Cascade Splits is a permissionless payment splitter on Solana. It allows you to distribute tokens from a vault to multiple recipients based on percentage allocations.

## What is Cascade Splits?

Cascade Splits lets you create a **vault** that automatically distributes incoming tokens to a predefined list of recipients. Each recipient receives their share based on a percentage you set when creating the split.

### Key Features

- **Permissionless execution** - Anyone can trigger the split distribution
- **On-chain configuration** - All split settings are stored on Solana
- **SPL Token support** - Works with any SPL token (USDC, etc.)
- **Transparent fees** - 1% protocol fee on distributions

## Quick Start

1. **Connect your wallet** at [cascade.fyi](https://cascade.fyi)
2. **Create a split** with your recipient addresses and percentages
3. **Share your vault address** to receive payments
4. **Execute the split** to distribute funds (anyone can do this)
